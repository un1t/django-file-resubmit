django-file-resubmit
====================

In Django project you have forms with FileField, ImageField. Everything works great, but
when ValidationError is raised, you have to reselect all files and images again. It is 
kind of annoying. **django-file-resubmit** solves this problem.
It works with FileField, ImageField and sorl.thumbnail.ImageField. 

How does it work?
=================

Here are special widgets for FileField and ImageField. When you submit files, every widget 
saves its file in cache. And when ValidationError is raised, widgets restore files from cache. 


Compatible with sorl-thumbnails
===============================

It is compatible with `sorl-thumbnail <https://github.com/jazzband/sorl-thumbnail>`_.
